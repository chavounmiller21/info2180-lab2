           <p> It's never too late to start college or even further your education. I started college at the age of 25 due to a lack of finances and 

            also no support or guidance. At first I was truly scared but look at me now in my final year and on my way to becoming the first

            person in my family to attend university. The journey is not yet over but I learned some valuable lessons along the way and 

            interacted with some amazing people and also got exposed to new things. Life is short sometimes you have to make the step and take

            the risk.</p>

            <p>I really and truly hope to be financially stable after completign this degree though because I have been poor my entire life and being

            poor feels like a death sentence to be honest. My family is also startign to show some level of moral support these days and I am happier

            than I have ever been. I was forunate to make the dean's list but unfortunately my GPa droped because second year computing courses were

            created by the devil himself. I will try again though and I will definitely keep you posted so stay tuned and look out for my next blog.

        <p>I only have vague memories of having a united childhood. I was five when my family life came crashing down only it didn't fall on me,
        
        it fell on my step-mother. The only memories I have of the divorce are not of a courtroom, but of my loving father being kicked out of the house

        he built from scratch. It was not until I was around seven that I learned my step-mother left my dad just because she was bored. 

        The first time I spent with my dad after the divorce was awesome we actually went fishing and could finally bond like son and father

        and that bond was missing from the day he got married. I knew he was sad because he loved his wife but deep down I was glad I only pretended

        to be sad as a means of providing some type of comfort for him.</p>

        <p>
            I am honestly out of stuff to write I have writer's block. I hate writing if I am being honest that's why I steared clear of courses

            that requires me to write essays. No matter how difficult computing and mathemeatics is I prefer to struggle with algortithms and 
            
            and equations I mean what if the teacher who is markign my essay does not like me? That teacher can or will just fail me if she 

            feels to. Nope! I am totally against that I honestly even wanted to write onyl a few words but this project required two I mean

            two entire paragraphs, what is this Computer Literature?</p>
